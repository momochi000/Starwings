Description
==========
2D top down space flight/battle game in javascript for HTML5 canvas using
the Crafty js game engine.

Questions
==========
What is the scale of the game? I'm not talking about the scope but what is the 
relationship between one pixel on the screen and game dimensions in kilometers
and so forth? I'm sure most games don't worry about this unless they're complex
simulations but in order to get the right feel I do want some simple physics
to apply to the objects in space.  With that we have to think of formulae.
With that we must think of units.  With units we must think of scale. Am I
overthinking things? maybe...

TODO/LEFT OFF
version: 0.2
==========
- Thinking about adding unit tests for vector and physics classes
- Previously, player ship data and controls were stored in a special player
  component.  In the process of generalizing this to it's own ship component
  and keeping player specific information in the player component.
- Abstract out the ship inputs into a single vector (helm vector)
- Create the controller which takes input vector and determines how to
  apply engine thrust (Ship component) 
- Be sure all component declarations/definitions are capitalized. Crafty 0.4
  changed this.
